Create a Pool:

Go to Local Traffic > Pools and click on Create.
Provide a name for the pool (e.g., "redis-pool").
Add the IP addresses and ports of the Redis servers to the pool.
Create a Health Monitor:

Go to Local Traffic > Monitors and click on Create.
Choose the appropriate monitor type for Redis (e.g., TCP, HTTP, etc.) and configure the necessary settings (e.g., interval, timeout).
Create a Virtual Server:

Go to Local Traffic > Virtual Servers and click on Create.
Provide a name for the virtual server (e.g., "redis-virtual").
Set the IP address and port for the virtual server.
Select the appropriate protocol and default pool ("redis-pool").
Associate the health monitor created in Step 2 with the virtual server.
Create Profiles:

You may need to create and attach profiles to the virtual server based on your Redis implementation. Common profiles include TCP, HTTP, and SSL profiles.
Configure Persistence:

If needed, you can configure persistence to ensure that client requests are directed to the same Redis server for a specific session. Depending on your Redis implementation, you may choose the appropriate persistence method.
Update DNS or Load Balancer Configuration:

Update your DNS or load balancer configuration to point the Redis clients to the virtual server IP address and port.
Test and Monitor:

Test the configuration to ensure that the Redis clients can successfully connect to the virtual server and that the load balancing is working as expected.
Monitor the virtual server and pool to ensure that the Redis instances are evenly balanced and healthy.
Please note that the specific steps may vary depending on the F5 BIG-IP version and your Redis implementation. Always follow best practices and consult the official F5 documentation for detailed guidance on configuring load balancing for Redis on your F5 BIG-IP device. Additionally, consider security measures such as restricting access to the virtual server IP and implementing SSL if required to protect data in transit.
